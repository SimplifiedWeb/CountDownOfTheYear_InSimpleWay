so countdown of the year which means we counting the days, hours,minutes, seconds left to the new year.
so simple calculation,

we use new Date() to get all the current hours, minutes, dates everything 

than we use new Date() and pass it down the next year, and then we get the exact date, minutes and everything

than we have to just minus it from the current Date and the intialize date like Date(2025, 4, 3) like that than just

minus it from today and that Date and we get the anwers and set it.
